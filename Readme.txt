Game Title:  Work in Progress (maybe G run)

Game Play: 
For now this game will work as an endurance game. 
The player would move the character in a fixed level size collecting coins while avoiding the enemy. 
If the player’s character gets hit by the enemy then it will lose health, eventually the player will die and lose a life. 
If no more lives are left for the player then the game will be over and the player will receive their high score.

Player Controls:

Basic left right and jump controls using the keyboards arrow keys and the space bar.
The player has three lives and a health bar with 10 points.
The player will also have a score counter.


G:
	The G would follow the player slowly throughout the game using the following object (which is following the player) using the step movement.
	If the player gets hit when the GF is down the player will lose 1 health point (10 points total).
	Everything that the G steps on will get crush depending on the object.
	
	In the Future:
	-The G would have more attacks such as kicking and stomping.
	-Maybe add a mini-game where the player avoids getting eaten by the G
	-Better animations and sounds   

NPCs:
-Humans
	For now the humans spawn randomly on the map standing still until the G moves into range.
	The humans will run alway from the G at a random rate of speed. If the G is right on top of the on of the humans, then the NPC will stop and (play animation) scream.
	
	In the Future:
	-Army and Police would not run and attempt to shoot the G. They would also have different weapons (hand guns, shot guns, rifles, rockets, etc). 

-Cars
	For now there is one type of car, the blue SUV. The cars will behave similar to the humans by speeding away from the G. The cars will have the same death animations as the humans.
	
	In the Future:
	
	-The cars will explode with fire, many damage the player if he or she is too close.
	-Another types of cars will include sedans, army Hummers, tanks, police cars, and trucks.
	-Cars could speed off in one direction, away from the G, potentially running over the play if he or she gets in the way.
	-Parked cars throughout the game.
	-Tanker trucks would explode injuring the player.
